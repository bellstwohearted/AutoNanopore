# AutoNanopore
An automated adaptive and robust method to locate translocation events in solid-state nanopore sequencing signals.

We performed the analysis by running the python scirpts. 

**For simplicity, we will release a GUI tool. It is still under construction, and will be available no later than May 15 of 2022.**
